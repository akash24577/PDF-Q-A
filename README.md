Project Title: RAG-Powered PDF Q&A System

Overview:

This project leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a robust question-answering system that can effectively process and understand PDF documents. The system utilizes a user-friendly Streamlit interface, integrates with powerful open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like those available on Hugging Face, and provides a REST API for seamless interaction.

Key Features:

Document Processing: Supports various input formats, including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and URLs.
Document Indexing: Efficiently indexes documents using FAISS for fast retrieval.
LLM Integration: Leverages Hugging Face's powerful language models for understanding and generating text.
RAG Implementation: Combines document retrieval with LLM capabilities to provide contextually relevant and informative answers.
User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction.
API Endpoint: REST API for programmatic access and integration with other applications.
Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests ensure code quality and robustness.
